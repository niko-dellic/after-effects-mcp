## 📦 Features

### 🎥 Core Composition Features
- **Create compositions** with custom settings (size, frame rate, duration, background color)
- **List all compositions** in a project
- **Get project information** such as frame rate, dimensions, and duration

### 🧱 Layer Management
- **Create text layers** with customizable properties (font, size, color, position)
- **Create shape layers** (rectangle, ellipse, polygon, star) with colors and strokes
- **Create solid/adjustment layers** for backgrounds and effects
- **Modify layer properties** like position, scale, rotation, opacity, and timing

### 🌀 Animation Capabilities
- **Set keyframes** for layer properties (Position, Scale, Rotation, Opacity, etc.)
- **Apply expressions** to layer properties for dynamic animations

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🛠 Prerequisites
- Adobe After Effects (2022 or later)
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dakkshin/after-effects-mcp.git
   cd after-effects-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Install the After Effects panel**
   
   **On macOS:**
   ```bash
   sudo npm run install-bridge
   ```
   (Requires sudo because it copies to `/Applications/Adobe After Effects [VERSION]/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`)
   
   **On Windows:**
   ```bash
   npm run install-bridge
   # or
   yarn install-bridge
   ```
   This will copy the necessary scripts to your After Effects installation.

### 🍎 macOS-Specific Notes

This project was originally built for Windows. The following changes were made to support macOS:

1. **Build script**: The `package.json` build script uses `cp -r` instead of Windows' `xcopy`:
   ```json
   "build": "tsc && cp -r src/scripts build/"
   ```

2. **Temp file paths**: Both the Node.js MCP server and the ExtendScript bridge use `/tmp` on macOS for command file communication:
   - Node.js checks `process.platform === 'darwin'` and uses `/tmp`
   - ExtendScript checks `$.os` for "Macintosh" and uses `/tmp`
   - On Windows, both use the system's `%TEMP%` folder

3. **After Effects paths**: The install script looks for After Effects at:
   - macOS: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects [YEAR]/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects [YEAR]\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`

4. **AE 2025 compatibility**: Added version detection for After Effects 2025+ which requires floating palette windows instead of dockable panels.

If the MCP Bridge Auto panel appears empty in After Effects, ensure you've:
1. Run `npm run build` to compile the latest code
2. Run `sudo npm run install-bridge` to copy the updated script to After Effects
3. Restarted After Effects completely

### 🔧 Update MCP Config

Go to your client (eg. Claude or Cursor) and update your config file.

**macOS example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AfterEffectsMCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/path/to/after-effects-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "AfterEffectsMCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\after-effects-mcp\\build\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ▶️ Running the Server

1. **Start the MCP server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Open After Effects**

3. **Open the MCP Bridge Auto panel**
   - In After Effects, go to Window > mcp-bridge-auto.jsx
   - The panel will automatically check for commands every few seconds
   - Make sure the "Auto-run commands" checkbox is enabled

## 🚀 Usage Guide

Once you have the server running and the MCP Bridge panel open in After Effects, you can control After Effects through the MCP protocol. This allows AI assistants or custom applications to send commands to After Effects.

### 📘 Creating Compositions

You can create new compositions with custom settings:
- Name
- Width and height (in pixels)
- Frame rate
- Duration
- Background color

Example MCP tool usage (for developers):
```javascript
mcp_aftereffects_create_composition({
  name: "My Composition", 
  width: 1920, 
  height: 1080, 
  frameRate: 30,
  duration: 10
});
```

### ✍️ Working with Layers

You can create and modify different types of layers:

**Text layers:**
- Set text content, font, size, and color
- Position text anywhere in the composition
- Adjust timing and opacity

**Shape layers:**
- Create rectangles, ellipses, polygons, and stars
- Set fill and stroke colors
- Customize size and position

**Solid layers:**
- Create background colors
- Make adjustment layers for effects

### 🕹 Animation

You can animate layers with:

**Keyframes:**
- Set property values at specific times
- Create motion, scaling, rotation, and opacity changes
- Control the timing of animations

**Expressions:**
- Apply JavaScript expressions to properties
- Create dynamic, procedural animations
- Connect property values to each other
